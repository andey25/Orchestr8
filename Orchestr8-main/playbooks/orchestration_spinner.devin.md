Follow this Playbook: Orchestrate tasks between multiple nodes effectively. 

## Procedure
0. Create a file log.txt, where you record everything that you do, including code execution, terminal commands, and reasoning. 
1. Ask the user to provide you information about the type of organization they want you to replicate. The user will tell you the different types of workers that they want their work to be split across. 
2. Think through what information will be shared between each node in the graph, where each graph represents a specific type of worker node. 
3. Create a high level diagram and display it so that we can monitor the information flow. 
4. For each node curate a playbook, which will be used to initialize that agent, providing it instructions about the task that it needs to do.
